Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times and delays in decision-making, and high dependency on manual intervention and individual staff knowledge. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3.

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring case volumes, workload distribution, SLA per\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times and delays in decision-making, and high dependency on manual intervention and individual staff knowledge. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and report\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4.

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4.

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring case volumes, workload distribution, SLA per\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring case volumes, workload distribution, SLA per\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring case volumes, workload distribution, SLA per\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4.

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4. Scope of Work\\nThe successful Bidder will be required to deliver, at minimum, the following:\\n\\n4.1 Solution Provisioning\\n- Provide an enterprise-grade BPM platform, licensed for MTI\\u2019s anticipated user base (internal and external users).\\n- Support both workbasket and worklist paradigms for task distribution and assignment.\\n- Provide role-based access control with integration to MTI\\u2019s identity management (e.g., Active Directory or equivalent).\\n\\n4.2 Process Areas in Scope\\nThe initial implementation will focus on, but is not limited to, the following processes:\\n- Business licensing and renewals.\\n- Incentive and grants application management.\\n- Trade facilitation case handling and approvals.\\n- Internal service requests (e.g., HR, Finance, IT service requests) as a shared services use case.\\nBidders should design their solutions in a way that additional processes can be onboarded rapidly using configuration rather than custom code.\\n\\n4.3 Implementation Services\\n- Requirements gathering and refinement in collaboration with MTI stakeholders.\\n- Process modelling and design using the proposed BPM platform.\\n- Design and implementation of user interfaces for different personas (case workers, supervisors, external users).\\n- Configuration of business rules, SLAs, escalations, and routing logic.\\n- Integration with existing systems such as document management, email, identity management, and core line-of-business systems.\\n- Data migration strategy (where applicable) from legacy systems or spreadsheets.\\n- System and integration testing, including performance and security testing.\\n- Support during user acceptance testing (UAT).\\n\\n4.4 Reporting and Analytics\\n- Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring case volumes, workload distribution, SLA per\"}"}]}

Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows. This RFP outlines the Ministry\\u2019s requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times, and high dependency on manual intervention. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4.
