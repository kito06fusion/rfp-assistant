Introduction\\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (\\\"MTI\\\" or \\\"the Ministry\\\") invites qualified vendors (\\\"Bidders\\\") to submit proposals for the supply, implementation, and ongoing support of an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) platform. The solution will be used to automate, monitor, and continuously improve MTI\\u2019s core business processes and related workflows.

Bidders are required to submit comprehensive, well-structured responses in accordance with the instructions provided in this document.\\n\\n2. Background\\nMTI is responsible for promoting sustainable economic growth, supporting businesses, facilitating trade, and encouraging investment. The Ministry currently operates multiple legacy systems and a number of manual, paper-based or email-driven processes for case handling, approvals, licensing, grants management, inspections, and stakeholder engagements. These fragmented processes lead to limited end-to-end visibility of cases and workloads, inconsistent application of business rules and policies, longer processing times and delays in decision-making, and high dependency on manual intervention and individual staff knowledge. To address these challenges, MTI intends to implement a modern, model-driven BPM platform with strong capabilities for case management, workflow orchestration, rules management, and integration with existing systems.\\n\\n3. Objectives\\nThe key objectives of this RFP are to:\\n- Implement a unified BPM platform to orchestrate and manage core MTI business processes.\\n- Provide a configurable case management capability that supports both structured and unstructured work.\\n- Enforce consistent application of business rules, policy, and regulatory requirements.\\n- Improve transparency and auditability through end-to-end tracking of cases, tasks, and SLAs.\\n- Enable faster introduction of new services and process changes via low-code configuration.\\n- Provide user-friendly interfaces for staff, management, and external stakeholders.\\n- Lay the foundation for analytics and continuous process improvement.\\n\\n4.
